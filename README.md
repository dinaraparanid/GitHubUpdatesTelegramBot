# GitHub Updates Telegram Bot

Telegram bot for GitHub developers' updates. It can help to track new projects and releases of the developers that you want to follow.

***Contact with the bot:* https://t.me/paranid5_gh_upd_bot**

**WARNING: The bot is OFFLINE** because of issues with VM. It'll be removed when I fix it

You can control it with the following commands:

***/follow* https://github.com/your_developer** - Starts tracking for the new releases of the developer. You will receive the message about the updates

***/unfollow* https://github.com/your_developer** - Stops tracking for the developer

***/projects* https://github.com/your_developer** - Shows all public repositories of the developer and their last releases (if there are any)

***/project_info* https://github.com/your_developer/his_project** - Shows the detailed information about the repository (description, license, last update, contributors, etc.)

If you have any difficulties or you've found a bug, please, contact the developer: **https://t.me/paranid5**
